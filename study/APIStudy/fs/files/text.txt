The first day I went to middle school, I found a special girl in my class. Her name sounds almost the same with mine. When the teachers or my classmates called one of us, we would both answer, then other students looked at us. We felt awkward. But soon we had our nicknames and it was convenient to distinguish us. Now we are good friends. Every time when we talk about the names, we think it is very interesting. We have a lot in common, which make our friendship become strong. I feel so lucky to find someone who shares the same interest with me, and the funny thing is that our names sound so closed.
